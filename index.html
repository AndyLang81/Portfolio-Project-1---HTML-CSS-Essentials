                <h2>Types of Yoga</h2>
                <p>Curious about the diverse world of yoga practices? At our studio, we embrace a range of styles to
                    cater to every individual's journey towards well-being and self-discovery. Whether you're seeking
                    grounding, fluidity, or spiritual awakening, we have something for everyone.</p>
                <p>Hatha yoga is the foundational practice from which many other styles have evolved. It emphasizes
                    physical postures (asanas) combined with breath control (pranayama) and meditation. Hatha classes
                    are typically gentle and slow-paced, making them suitable for beginners and experienced
                    practitioners alike. The focus is on aligning the body, calming the mind, and fostering a sense
                    of balance and harmony within.</p>
                <p>Vinyasa yoga is a dynamic and flowing style that synchronizes breath with movement. In Vinyasa
                    classes, students move through a series of poses in a smooth, continuous sequence, creating a
                    fluid and dance-like experience. The practice builds strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular
                    endurance while also cultivating mindfulness and presence. Vinyasa yoga offers creative freedom
                    for instructors to design sequences that vary in intensity and focus.</p>
                <p>Kundalini yoga is a spiritual and transformative practice that aims to awaken the dormant energy
                    (kundalini) believed to reside at the base of the spine. This style incorporates dynamic
                    movements, breathing techniques, chanting, and meditation to stimulate the flow of energy
                    throughout the body. Kundalini classes often involve repetitive movements (known as kriyas) and
                    specific sequences designed to balance the chakras and elevate consciousness. The practice is
                    known for its powerful effects on both physical vitality and spiritual awakening.</p>
