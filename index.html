        <h2>Types of yoga</h2>
        <p>Hatha yoga is the foundational practice from which many other styles have evolved. It emphasizes physical postures (asanas) combined with breath control (pranayama) and meditation. Hatha classes are typically gentle and slow-paced, making them suitable for beginners and experienced practitioners alike. The focus is on aligning the body, calming the mind, and fostering a sense of balance and harmony within.</p>
        <p>Vinyasa yoga is a dynamic and flowing style that synchronizes breath with movement. In Vinyasa classes, students move through a series of poses in a smooth, continuous sequence, creating a fluid and dance-like experience. The practice builds strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular endurance while also cultivating mindfulness and presence. Vinyasa yoga offers creative freedom for instructors to design sequences that vary in intensity and focus.</p>
        <p>Kundalini yoga is a spiritual and transformative practice that aims to awaken the dormant energy (kundalini) believed to reside at the base of the spine. This style incorporates dynamic movements, breathing techniques, chanting, and meditation to stimulate the flow of energy throughout the body. Kundalini classes often involve repetitive movements (known as kriyas) and specific sequences designed to balance the chakras and elevate consciousness. The practice is known for its powerful effects on both physical vitality and spiritual awakening.</p>
